## WolfScale — Database Replication

**Database replication, clustering, and load balancing — the easy way**

WolfScale is a lightweight, high-availability replication layer for MariaDB/MySQL. It provides **automatic leader election** with deterministic failover, **WAL-based replication** for strong consistency, and a **MySQL-compatible proxy** for transparent routing—all in a single Rust binary.

Works with MySQL, Percona, and Amazon RDS • **MariaDB recommended**

### Why WolfScale?

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Sub-Millisecond Replication** | Push-based replication faster than MySQL, MariaDB, or Galera |
| **Zero Write Conflicts** | Single-leader model eliminates certification failures |
| **Predictable Failover** | Lowest node ID always wins—you know exactly who becomes leader |
| **Safe Node Rejoin** | Returning nodes sync via WAL before taking leadership |
| **Zero-Config Discovery** | Nodes find each other automatically via UDP broadcast |
| **Transparent Proxy** | Connect via MySQL protocol—no application changes needed |
| **Built-in Load Balancer** | Distribute connections across cluster nodes with automatic failover |
| **Single Binary** | No patched databases, no complex dependencies |

### Fastest Replication in the Industry

| System | Typical Replication Lag |
|--------|------------------------|
| MySQL Async | 100ms - seconds |
| MySQL Semi-Sync | 10-50ms |
| MariaDB Galera | 10-20ms |
| **WolfScale** | **<1ms** ⚡ |

### Quick Start

> **All cluster nodes MUST have identical data before starting WolfScale.** WolfScale replicates new changes only — it does NOT sync existing data between nodes.

```bash
# Install WolfScale on each server
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intelligentwolf/WolfScale/main/setup.sh | bash
```

### Load Balancer

Install the load balancer directly on any server that needs database access. It auto-discovers your cluster — no configuration needed.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intelligentwolf/WolfScale/main/setup_lb.sh | bash
```

```
Web Server 1 ─── WolfScale LB ───┐
             (auto-discovers)    │
                                 │
Web Server 2 ─── WolfScale LB ───┼──► WolfScale DB Cluster
             (auto-discovers)    │
                                 │
Web Server 3 ─── WolfScale LB ───┘
             (auto-discovers)
```

### Cluster Commands

```bash
wolfctl list servers     # Check cluster status
wolfctl stats            # Live throughput monitoring
wolfctl migrate --from 10.0.10.111:8080   # Migrate data to new node
wolfctl reset --force    # Reset WAL and state (DESTRUCTIVE)
```

## WolfDisk — Distributed Filesystem

**Disk sharing and replication across networks — the easy way**

WolfDisk is a FUSE-based distributed filesystem that shares and replicates files across Linux servers. Mount a shared directory on any number of machines and have your data automatically synchronised. Supports leader, follower, and client modes.

### Why WolfDisk?

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **FUSE-Based** | Mount as a regular filesystem—works with any application |
| **Automatic Replication** | Files sync to all nodes automatically |
| **Content-Addressed Storage** | Efficient deduplication via SHA256 chunking |
| **Leader-Follower Model** | Strong consistency with automatic failover |
| **Client Mode** | Workstations can access the shared drive without local storage |
| **Multiple Drives** | Run multiple independent filesystems per node |

### Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive installer - prompts for node ID, role, and discovery
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intelligentwolf/WolfScale/main/wolfdisk/setup.sh | bash
```

### Node Roles

| Role | Storage | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Leader** | ✅ Local | Primary node — accepts writes, replicates to followers |
| **Follower** | ✅ Local | Receives replicated data, can become leader on failover |
| **Client** | ❌ None | Mount-only — reads/writes forwarded to leader, no local data |
| **Auto** | ✅ Local | Auto-election — lowest ID becomes leader |

See [`wolfdisk/README.md`](wolfdisk/README.md) for full documentation.

## WolfNet — Private Networking

WolfNet creates a secure, encrypted private network between your machines over the internet. Machines on WolfNet can see each other as if they were on the same LAN, but all traffic is encrypted with modern cryptography (X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305 — the same crypto as WireGuard).

### Why WolfNet?

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **WireGuard-Class Crypto** | X25519 key exchange + ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD encryption |
| **Mesh Networking** | Every node can reach every other node directly — no single point of failure |
| **Invite/Join System** | Connect new peers with a single token — no manual key exchange |
| **Relay Forwarding** | Nodes behind NAT can communicate through a relay — no port forwarding needed |
| **Gateway Mode** | Route internet traffic through a gateway node with NAT masquerading |
| **LAN Auto-Discovery** | Nodes find each other automatically on the same network |
| **TUN-Based** | Uses kernel TUN interfaces for near-native performance |
| **Hostname/DynDNS** | Use hostnames in endpoints — re-resolved every 60s for dynamic IPs |
| **Single Binary** | No dependencies — just `wolfnet` and `wolfnetctl` |
| **Systemd Service** | Runs as a background service with automatic startup |

### Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive installer — downloads binary, generates keys, creates systemd service
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intelligentwolf/WolfScale/main/wolfnet/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

The installer will:
- Check for `/dev/net/tun` (with Proxmox/LXC guidance if missing)
- Download and install `wolfnet` and `wolfnetctl`
- Generate an X25519 keypair
- Prompt for WolfNet IP address, port, and gateway mode
- Create a systemd service for automatic startup

### Easy Peer Setup (Invite/Join)

Connect two machines in seconds — no manual key exchange:

```bash
# On the first machine (the one with a public IP / port forwarding):
sudo wolfnet invite

# Output:  sudo wolfnet --config /etc/wolfnet/config.toml join eyJwa...

# Copy that command and run it on the second machine:
sudo wolfnet --config /etc/wolfnet/config.toml join eyJwa...

# It will output a reverse token — run that on the first machine:
sudo wolfnet --config /etc/wolfnet/config.toml join eyJlc...

# Restart WolfNet on both:
sudo systemctl restart wolfnet
```

The invite token auto-detects the node's public IP, includes the public key, and assigns WolfNet IPs automatically.

### NAT Traversal (Relay Forwarding)

WolfNet supports **relay forwarding** so machines behind NAT firewalls can communicate without port forwarding:

```
Laptop (behind NAT)          Server (public IP)           Home PC (behind NAT)
    10.0.10.1                   10.0.10.2                   10.0.10.3
        │                           │                           │
        └───── encrypted UDP ──────►│◄────── encrypted UDP ─────┘
                                    │
                             Relay forwards
                            packets between
                           Laptop ◄──► Home PC
```

**How it works:**
1. Both the laptop and home PC connect to the server (which has a public IP)
2. When the laptop sends a packet to the home PC, the server detects it's not the destination
3. The server decrypts, re-encrypts for the home PC, and forwards it
4. This happens automatically — no configuration needed
5. Any node that can be reached by both parties can act as a relay

### Peer Discovery Methods

WolfNet supports three ways to find and connect to peers — mix and match as needed:

| Method | Use Case | Config |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **LAN Auto-Discovery** | Machines on the same network | `discovery = true` (default) |
| **Static IP** | VPS, dedicated servers, data centres | `endpoint = "203.0.113.5:9600"` |
| **Hostname / DynDNS** | Home broadband, dynamic IPs | `endpoint = "myhome.dyndns.org:9600"` |

Hostnames are resolved on startup and **re-resolved every 60 seconds**, so DynDNS changes are picked up automatically. Works with any DNS provider — DynDNS, No-IP, Cloudflare, DuckDNS, or your own domain.

### Multi-Server Deployment (Static IPs)

Link multiple standalone servers across different locations into a single WolfNet mesh:

```
Server A (London)              Server B (New York)           Server C (Tokyo)
  Public: 203.0.113.5            Public: 198.51.100.10         Public: 192.0.2.50
  WolfNet: 10.0.10.1             WolfNet: 10.0.10.2            WolfNet: 10.0.10.3
       │                              │                             │
       └────── encrypted UDP ────────►│◄───── encrypted UDP ────────┘
```

1. Install WolfNet on each server, giving each a unique WolfNet IP
2. Use `sudo wolfnet invite` on one server to generate invite tokens
3. Run the invite command on each other server to exchange keys
4. Restart WolfNet — PEX automatically propagates the full mesh topology

> 💡 **You don't need a full mesh in the config.** Each server only needs to know about at least one other server. PEX shares the rest automatically within 30 seconds.

[network]
address = "10.0.10.1"
listen_port = 9600
discovery = true        # LAN auto-discovery (default)

# Static IP peer
[[peers]]
public_key = "BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY"
endpoint = "203.0.113.5:9600"
allowed_ip = "10.0.10.2"
name = "london-vps"

# DynDNS hostname peer (re-resolved every 60s)
[[peers]]
public_key = "ANOTHER_PUBLIC_KEY"
endpoint = "myhome.dyndns.org:9600"
allowed_ip = "10.0.10.3"
name = "home-server"
```

### Running on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

WolfNet is a Linux-native tool that talks directly to the kernel TUN driver (`/dev/net/tun`). That makes WSL support entirely dependent on which WSL version you're on:

| WSL Version | Supported? | Why |
|-------------|------------|-----|
| **WSL1** | ❌ No | WSL1 is a syscall-translation layer with no `/dev/net/tun`. WolfNet exits immediately on startup with `Failed to open /dev/net/tun`. There's no workaround — WSL1 can't run any TUN/TAP-based VPN. |
| **WSL2** | ✅ Yes (with caveats) | WSL2 runs a real Linux kernel. Recent Microsoft kernel images ship with `CONFIG_TUN=y`, so the TUN device is available and WolfNet's data plane runs normally. |

**Setting it up on WSL2:**

1. **Check the TUN device exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/net/tun
   ```
   If missing, run `wsl --update` from PowerShell to pull the latest Microsoft kernel.

2. **Pick a networking mode.** By default WSL2 sits behind a NAT'd Hyper-V virtual switch, so **inbound** UDP from peers won't reach you. Three options, best first:

   - **Mirrored mode (Windows 11 22H2+, recommended)** — WSL2 shares the Windows host's IPs directly, no NAT. Add to `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig` on the Windows side:
     ```ini
     [wsl2]
     networkingMode=mirrored
     ```
     Then `wsl --shutdown` and restart your WSL distro. Inbound UDP now works as if WolfNet were running on the Windows host itself.

   - **Outbound-only with relay** — if you have at least one peer with a public IP, the WSL2 node connects out to it and other peers reach you via [Relay Forwarding](#nat-traversal-relay-forwarding). No Windows-side config needed. This is the easiest setup for laptop / dev-box use.

   - **Manual port forwarding** — `netsh interface portproxy` on Windows is TCP-only and won't help with WolfNet's UDP. If you must use the default NATed networking mode and need direct inbound, a third-party tool like [`wsl-portforward`](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150) or a UDP forwarder is required.

3. **Auto-start on `wsl` boot.** WSL2 doesn't run systemd by default. Enable it in `/etc/wsl.conf`:
   ```ini
   [boot]
   systemd=true
   ```
   Then `wsl --shutdown` to apply. `systemctl enable --now wolfnet` then works as on any Linux host.

4. **Install:** the standard installer works on WSL2 once the above is in place:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intelligentwolf/WolfScale/main/wolfnet/setup.sh | sudo bash
   ```
   The setup script now detects Arch/Manjaro/CachyOS, openSUSE, and Alpine in addition to Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/RHEL, so most WSL distros are covered out of the box.

**What WSL2 won't give you:** Windows applications (browsers, RDP clients, etc.) **cannot** see WolfNet IPs in the default networking mode — only processes inside the WSL2 instance can. Mirrored mode is the only way for Windows-side apps to use WolfNet routes.

### Security

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Key Exchange | **X25519** (Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman) |
| Encryption | **ChaCha20-Poly1305** AEAD (256-bit) |
| Replay Protection | Counter-based nonces with monotonic validation |
| Network Isolation | iptables firewall blocks all external inbound traffic |
| Key Storage | Private keys stored with 0600 permissions |

> ⚠️ **Proxmox/LXC Users:** The TUN device (`/dev/net/tun`) is blocked by default in LXC containers. See [wolfscale.org/wolfnet.html](https://wolfscale.org/wolfnet.html) for setup instructions.

## Architecture (WolfScale)

| Layer        | Component                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Applications | Connect via HTTP API or MySQL Protocol          |
| WolfScale    | Leader + Followers replicate via WAL            |
| Database     | Each node has local MariaDB (localhost:3306)    |

**Write Flow:** Client → Any Node → Forwarded to Leader → Replicated to All Nodes

**Read Flow:** Client → Any Node → Local Data (or forwarded to Leader if node is behind)

## Cluster Sizing

| Nodes | Fault Tolerance   | Use Case                        |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1     | None              | Development only                |
| 2     | 1 node failure    | Basic HA (not recommended)      |
| 3     | 2 node failures   | Minimum for production          |
| 5     | 4 node failures   | Recommended for production      |
| 7     | 6 node failures   | High availability               |

**Geo-Distribution:** Nodes can be deployed across different data centres or regions. Connect to your nearest node for low-latency reads — if the data isn't up-to-date, the request is automatically forwarded to the leader.

> **Note:** WolfScale doesn't use quorum — only one node needs to survive. While the cluster can run on a single remaining node, it's recommended to maintain at least 2 active nodes for redundancy.
